# Invoking Lambda Functions

Invocation of lambda functions can be done either by trigger or by schedule

## Invocation by trigger

TBD

## Invocation by Schedule

- Create a cloudwatch event rule with fixed time interval (for periodic checks)
- Trigger Lambda function (with dummy JSON input if Function doesn't take input)
- Ref Screenshots
